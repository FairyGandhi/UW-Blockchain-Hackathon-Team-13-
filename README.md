### About <a name="description"></a>
+ Whenever we are buying a prodcut, we always have concerns of whether the product is genuine or not. Counterfeiting has become a global problem. There are fake counterfeited items of famous brand sold by manufacturers at a cheaper rate. And no one (including the company officials) can identify whether the particular product is fake or not. 

### Objective <a name="objective"></a>
+ FindTheFake is intended to use NEAR platform protocol for implementation of Smart-Contracts.

### Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>
+ Within our use of the NEAR API, we will utilize context to By using contracts, our product will be able to identify the authenticity of a given products upon the genesis of it’s initial distribution from it’s manufacturer.
